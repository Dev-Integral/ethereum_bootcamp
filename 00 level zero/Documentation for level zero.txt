Although the source code above for level zero was unavailable before cracking 
the level. I was able to interact with the ABI by listing the functions available.
It was observed that the function password was made public which was a vulnerability.
I noticed its value is "ethernaut0" then I used it in for authentication by passing 
it into contract.authenticate("ethernaut0").
